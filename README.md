# Loan-Data-set
1. How is the loan grade assigned to a borrower? Which variables are highly related to the loan grade? 
2. If a person requires a loan, can you build a model to predict whether the guy is trustworthy enough to get fully funded based on his credit score, salary, state of residence, etc? For simplicity, you can set "1" if the guy can get full money, otherwise set "0". So this becomes a 2-class classification problem.
3. Can you predict the interest rate according to the person's background or history information? Which variables are more important?
4. For time series, can you detect any change point that means the time trend had suddenly changed after a timestamp?  Some new published policies or big political events may explain this phenomenon.
